Great little game produced by one of our work experience students on the last day of the week, with only minimal prior exposure to programming. I see a bright future ahead! 

Implements loads of classic game features like enemy spawners, score counter, player movement, basic collision detection, player health, enemy health, and most importantly the Game Over screen!

(By the way we definitely did some 'real' work earlier in the week!)
