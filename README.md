Great little game produced by one of our work experience students on the last couple of days of the week, with only minimal prior exposure to programming.

Implements loads of classic game features like enemy spawners, score counter, player movement, basic collision detection, player health, enemy health, and most importantly the Game Over screen!

I saw Denys developing excellent programming habits in real time without having to prompt it at all. Consistent naming styles, tidy code layout, and more. I was repeatedly impressed by his intuition into bugs and other issues, several times suggesting a fix before I'd even formed the thought myself. The suggestions weren't always correct but they showed me that he was really starting to understanding what was going on. More than once he just told me to 'wait a minute' while he went ahead and implemented a whole feature or fix by himself. Denys had good insights into the mathematical parts and showed a clear understanding of the geometry of a Unity scene when we had issues with camera positioning and strange, unexpected rotations. I see a bright future ahead!

(By the way, we definitely did some 'real' work earlier in the week!)

Denys, if you have any trouble getting this to work on your machine please feel free to get in touch any time.
